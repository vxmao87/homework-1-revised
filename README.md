# homework-1-revised

This is the first homework of the UW Coding Bootcamp, where I am tasked with taking a set of code both in HTML and CSS, and repurposing both to ensure accesibility. By accessibility, that means the code is easy for any scanners to understand, and that semantic references are used. Any HTML syntax that is purely used for coding purposes are removed and replaced with easier-to-understand and purposeful syntax. Besides accessibility, I have also made changes to the CSS code to make it more efficient.

Throughout this process, I've learned that it is very easy to get mixed with code just by itself, hence adding comments will make the overall code more accessibile to anyone who just wants a quick glance at the code or is looking to find a better structure for code that seems too cluttered. I do have some confusion as to how to replace the 'span' element, even with the help of Google.
